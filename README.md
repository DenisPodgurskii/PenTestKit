# pentestkit

Penetration Testing Kit features:

1) Dashboard contains information about client/server technologies, libraries and frameworks. Additional checks for OWASP security headers, WAF and authentication state like local storage, cookie or JWT token.

2) Proxy contains all requests for selected tab where you can filter by method, url, host or status. Or just send any particular request to R-Builder or R-Attacker.

3) Request Builder allows you to modify any request and execute it within the browser. Need to check what happens if you send a SQL injection or XSS attack? Just use this request builder, modify the parameters, execute the request and check it right in your browser.

4) Request attacker. We have created a list of attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, CMD and JWT attack that can be executed automatically, while you browsing the application.

5) Decoder/Encoder tool allows you decode or encode any string with no needs in any other tools.

6) And yeah, Swagger UI is there as well. Make you work with APIs easier. 

Essential application security tools right in your browser!
